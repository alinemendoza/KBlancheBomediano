Title: Musentality (Music Mentality) 
<br>
<br>
Description: The effects of music are many, but this will focus on the psychological and mental side of it. When listening to upbeat and happy music, it can make the brain release serotonin and make the listener happy, while calm music can make the brain relax or make the listener at ease. It also has the ability to imbue itself in a listener’s memories, to make him/her feel a sense of nostalgia. It is also seen in many businesses’ jingles or songs playing to help consumers remember or recognize their brand.
